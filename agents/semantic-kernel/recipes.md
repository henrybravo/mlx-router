## 1️⃣ Grilled Rib‑Eye Steak & Butter‑Basted Eggs

**Why it works:**
A classic steak‑and‑eggs combo, but the whole dish is cooked in animal fat, keeping it pure‑meat and ultra‑satiating.

### Ingredients
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Rib‑eye steak (1‑inch thick, bone‑in if you like) | 12 oz (≈340 g) |
| Sea salt (or pink Himalayan) | 1 ½ tsp |
| Beef tallow or clarified butter (ghee) | 2 Tbsp |
| Large eggs | 4 |
| Optional: a few slices of high‑fat cheese (e.g., cheddar) | 2 oz |

### Equipment
* Grill (or cast‑iron skillet on the grill)
* Tongs
* Small heat‑proof pan or skillet for the eggs
* Spoon for basting

### Method
1. **Season the steak** generously on both sides with salt. Let it sit at room temperature for 10 min (helps even cooking).
2. **Pre‑heat the grill** to high heat (≈500 °F/260 °C). Brush the grill grates with a thin layer of beef tallow to prevent sticking.
3. **Sear the steak**: place directly on the grill, 2 min per side for a nice crust.
4. **Finish to medium‑rare** (internal temp 130 °F/54 °C) by moving the steak to a cooler part of the grill or using indirect heat for another 3‑4 min total.
5. **Rest** the steak loosely tented with foil for 5 min.
6. While the steak rests, **heat a small skillet** on the grill (or a cast‑iron pan on the stovetop) and melt 1 Tbsp of beef tallow.
7. **Crack the eggs** into the hot fat, season with a pinch of salt, and cook **sunny‑side‑up** (or flip for over‑easy). Spoon the melted tallow over the whites for extra moisture.
8. **Plate**: slice the steak thinly, arrange the eggs alongside, and drizzle the remaining 1 Tbsp melted tallow (or melt a little cheese over the steak if you like).

## 2️⃣ Beef Breakfast Kebabs (Ground Beef & Beef Bacon)

**Why it works:**
Ground beef is inexpensive and quick, while crisp‑edged beef bacon adds texture and extra fat. All components can be grilled in one go.

### Ingredients
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Ground beef (80 % lean / 20 % fat) | 1 lb (≈450 g) |
| Beef bacon strips (thin) | 8 – 10 strips |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Optional: beef gelatin (for extra binding) | ½ tsp |
| Beef tallow (for greasing) | 1 Tbsp |

### Equipment
* Metal or stainless‑steel skewers (soak wooden ones 30 min in water if you prefer)
* Grill grates

### Method
1. **Mix the meat**: In a bowl, combine ground beef, salt, and gelatin (if using). Mix just until combined—over‑mixing makes it tough.
2. **Form small patties** (about 2 oz each) and press a strip of beef bacon around the edge of each patty, overlapping the ends to seal.
3. **Thread onto skewers**: Alternate a bacon‑wrapped patty with a short piece of plain ground‑beef patty to keep the kebab balanced.
4. **Pre‑heat the grill** to medium‑high (≈425 °F/220 °C) and brush the grates lightly with melted tallow.
5. **Grill the kebabs**: 4 min per side, or until the internal temperature hits 160 °F (71 °C) and the bacon is crisp. Rotate as needed to avoid flare‑ups.
6. **Rest 2 min** before serving (the juices redistribute).

## 3️⃣ Grilled Beef Bone Marrow “Egg‑Style” & Fat‑Rendered Rib‑Tips

**Why it works:**
Bone marrow is a carnivore super‑food—rich in collagen, micronutrients, and buttery fat. Pairing it with rib‑tips gives a hearty, steak‑house‑style breakfast.

### Ingredients
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Beef rib‑tips (cut into 1‑inch cubes) | 8 oz (≈225 g) |
| Beef marrow bones (split, marrow exposed) | 2 × 3‑inch sections |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Beef tallow (or melted beef suet) | 2 Tbsp |
| Optional: a splash of bone broth for extra moisture | ¼ cup |

### Equipment
* Grill with a “direct heat” zone and an “indirect” zone (or a two‑zone fire)
* Small cast‑iron skillet (or a grill‑safe pan) for the marrow
* Tongs and a small spoon for extracting marrow

### Method
1. **Season the rib‑tips** with salt and toss in 1 Tbsp melted tallow to coat.
2. **Set up the grill**: high direct heat on one side, medium indirect heat on the other.
3. **Sear rib‑tips** directly over the flame, 2 min per side, until a dark crust forms. Transfer them to the indirect zone, close the lid, and **cook 8‑10 min** more (target internal temp 190 °F/88 °C for tender, fall‑off‑the‑bone texture).
4. **Prepare the marrow**: place the split marrow bones marrow‑side up on a piece of foil (or a grill‑safe pan). Brush with the remaining 1 Tbsp tallow and sprinkle a pinch of salt.
5. **Grill the marrow** over indirect heat, **covered**, for 12‑15 min, until the marrow is soft and bubbling.
6. **“Egg‑style” serving**: while the marrow cooks, **scrape the soft marrow** into a small bowl, add a splash of hot bone broth (optional) and whisk quickly—this creates a rich, custard‑like sauce.
7. **Plate**: arrange the rib‑tips on a plate, spoon the warm marrow “egg” sauce over the top, and finish with a final pinch of salt.

## Quick Carnivore‑Friendly Tips for All Recipes

| Tip | How it helps |
|-----|--------------|
| **Use a meat thermometer** | Guarantees safe doneness without over‑cooking (especially for steak). |
| **Season with salt only** | Keeps the diet pure; salt also restores electrolytes lost on a low‑carb regimen. |
| **Add animal‑based fats (tallow, ghee, beef suet)** | Increases satiety, improves flavor, and supplies essential fatty acids. |
| **Rest meat 5‑10 min** | Allows juices to redistribute, giving a juicier bite. |
