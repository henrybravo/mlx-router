## 1️⃣ Grilled Rib‑Eye Steak & Butter‑Egg “Surf‑and‑Turf”

**Servings:** 1 hearty breakfast
**Time:** 15 min (plus 5 min grill pre‑heat)

### Ingredients
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Rib‑eye steak (1‑inch thick) | 8 oz (225 g) |
| Salt (sea or kosher) | ½ tsp |
| Unsalted butter (or ghee) | 2 Tbsp |
| Large eggs | 2 |
| Optional: a few slices of hard‑cheese (e.g., aged cheddar) | 1 oz |

### Equipment
- Grill (direct‑heat zone) or cast‑iron grill pan
- Small skillet (if you finish the eggs on the stovetop)

### Method
1. **Pre‑heat** the grill to high (≈ 450‑500 °F / 230‑260 °C).
2. **Season** the rib‑eye liberally with salt on both sides. No other seasonings are needed for a pure carnivore palate.
3. **Grill the steak** directly over the flame: 4 min per side for medium‑rare, 5‑6 min for medium. Use tongs—never pierce the meat.
4. While the steak rests, **melt 1 Tbsp butter** in a small skillet over medium‑high heat.
5. **Crack the eggs** into the butter. Let the whites set, then gently flip once (or cover the pan briefly to finish the top without flipping). Cook to your preferred doneness—sunny‑side‑up is classic, but a quick flip gives a firmer yolk.
6. **Plate**: Slice the steak thinly, lay the butter‑cooked eggs beside it, and melt the remaining butter (or a slice of cheese) over the top for extra richness.
7. **Enjoy** while hot. The combination of juicy beef and buttery eggs gives you protein, fat, and the satisfying “meat‑first” flavor you crave.

## 2️⃣ Beef Bacon‑Wrapped Breakfast Sausage Patties

**Servings:** 2 (2 patties each)
**Time:** 20 min (including grill time)

### Ingredients
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Ground beef (80 % lean / 20 % fat) | 1 lb (450 g) |
| Beef bacon strips (thick cut) | 8 – 10 strips |
| Salt | 1 tsp |
| Egg (optional binder) | 1, lightly beaten |
| Beef tallow or melted butter (for greasing) | 1 Tbsp |

### Equipment
- Grill (medium‑high heat) or grill pan
- Kitchen twine or toothpicks (optional, for securing)

### Method
1. **Form the sausage**: In a bowl, combine ground beef, salt, and the beaten egg (the egg helps the patty hold together but can be omitted if you prefer pure meat). Mix just until combined—over‑mixing can make the patty tough. Shape into 8 equal balls, then flatten each to a ½‑inch thick patty.
2. **Wrap** each patty with 1‑2 strips of beef bacon, overlapping the ends. Secure with a toothpick or a short piece of kitchen twine if needed.
3. **Pre‑heat** the grill to medium‑high (≈ 400 °F / 200 °C). Lightly brush the grill grates with melted tallow or butter to prevent sticking.
4. **Grill** the bacon‑wrapped patties for 4‑5 min per side, or until the bacon is crisp and the interior reaches about 150 °F (65 °C). The bacon will render its own fat, keeping the patty juicy.
5. **Rest** 2 min before removing the toothpicks/twine. Serve the patties whole or slice them for a “breakfast meat board.”

*Tip:* If you like a little extra melt‑in‑fat, drizzle a spoonful of warm beef tallow over the finished patties.

## 3️⃣ Grilled Beef Liver & Egg “Carnivore Omelette”

**Servings:** 1
**Time:** 12 min (plus 5 min grill pre‑heat)

> **Why liver?** It’s a nutrient powerhouse (vitamin A, B‑12, iron) and pairs beautifully with the richness of eggs.

### Ingredients
| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Beef liver (sliced ¼‑inch thick) | 6 oz (170 g) |
| Salt | ½ tsp |
| Clarified butter or beef tallow | 2 Tbsp |
| Large eggs | 3 |
| Optional: a splash of heavy cream (for extra fluff) | 1 Tbsp |

### Equipment
- Grill (direct‑heat zone) or grill pan
- Small non‑stick skillet (or cast‑iron) for the eggs

### Method
1. **Season the liver**: Sprinkle both sides with salt. If you have a bit of time, let it sit 5 min to draw out any residual blood—then pat dry.
2. **Grill the liver**: Heat the grill to medium‑high. Brush the grates with melted tallow. Place liver slices directly on the grill, 2‑3 min per side, until a dark caramelized crust forms but the interior is still pink (avoid over‑cooking; liver gets tough). Remove and set aside.
3. **Prepare the eggs**: In a bowl, whisk the three eggs (add cream if using) with a pinch of salt.
4. **Cook the “omelette”**: In a skillet over medium heat, melt 1 Tbsp tallow. Pour the beaten eggs, swirling to coat the pan. As the edges set, gently lift them with a spatula, letting uncooked egg flow underneath. When the surface is still slightly runny but the base is firm, **layer the grilled liver slices** over one half of the egg.
5. **Fold** the omelette in half, covering the liver. Cook another 30 sec‑1 min to finish setting the interior.
6. **Slide onto a plate** and top with the remaining 1 Tbsp melted tallow for extra gloss and flavor.

*Optional garnish*: a few shards of aged cheese melted on top (if dairy is part of your carnivore regimen).

### Quick Carnivore‑Friendly Tips for All Recipes
- **Salt is your primary seasoning** – it enhances flavor and replaces the electrolytes you lose on a meat‑heavy diet.
- **Use animal fats** (tallow, butter, ghee) for grilling and pan‑frying; they add mouth‑watering richness and keep you satiated.
- **Rest meat** (5‑10 min) after grilling; it lets juices redistribute and yields a juicier bite.
- **Keep a meat thermometer** handy. For beef steak, 130‑135 °F (54‑57 °C) is medium‑rare; for liver, 130‑140 °F (54‑60 °C) preserves tenderness.

Enjoy these beef‑centric breakfasts and let the grill do the heavy lifting! Happy hunting (and grilling). 🍖🥚
